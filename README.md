# Social-Network-API

## Technology's Used
MongoDB 
Mongoose





## Description

This project is a backend of what could be a Social Network API. Using MongoDB and Mongoose I was able to successfully create models for Users and Thoughts that users could create. Users also have the ability to befriend one another and add reactions to thoughts as well.

## Learning-Points
This activity was similar to another acitivity we did when we were learning MySQL and had to create Restful API Routes for that database there as well. MongoDB is quite different from SQL, it is less rigid and that took me some getting used to. I am still learing monogoose but i am enjoying it so far. Big learning point for me was really understanding Mongoose and how you can create a schema for something without creating a model for it and still use that schema in another model. It is essentially like a foreign key but you can really manipulate the date in many other ways. I also like the way mongoose uses virtuals to get data on (in this case) users friends counts. It is a cool way to show information and I can see how this will be super useful in project 3.
